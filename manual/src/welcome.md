# Welcome

Welcome to the `renderling` operator's manual!

`renderling` is a cutting-edge, GPU-driven renderer designed to efficiently
handle complex scenes by leveraging GPU capabilities for most rendering
operations. It is particularly suited for indie game developers and researchers
interested in high-performance graphics rendering while working with GLTF files
and large-scale scenes.

The library is written in Rust and supports modern rendering techniques such as
forward+ rendering and physically based shading, making it ideal for
applications requiring advanced lighting and material effects.
