While adding WASM support I found that my shaders were not validating in the browser.
Apparently this is because of an extra traspilation step from spv -> wgsl - because when targeting WebGPU in the browser, shaders must be written in WGSL, and naga's WGSL backend doesn't like infinities or NaNs.
Here's [the related ticket](https://github.com/gfx-rs/naga/issues/2461).
I ended up having to track down all the infinity and NaN comparisons and replace the functions that have those comparisons in their call trees. I then created a clippy lint to disallow those functions.

I tried to bump `rust-gpu` to 0.9 but ran into [an issue](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-gpu/issues/1089) where shaders that previously compiled no longer compile.
`spirv-opt` was erring because it didn't like _something_.
I'm working with @eddyb to figure out what the problem is.
Here's a link to the start of the [conversation](https://discord.com/channels/750717012564770887/750717499737243679/1136766077330796595).

I also fixed an issue where two versions of `glam` were being built - `0.22` by `spirv-std` and `0.24` by `rendeling-shader`, which was causing CI to fail.

I greatly reduced the artifacts in the prefiltered environment cube used for specular highlights.
I did this by using a simplified `calc_lod` and also by generating enough mipmaps.
Previously I was only making 5 mip levels but the `calc_lod` was often requiring 21+!
Of course the environment cubemap's face size is only 512, which leads to 9 mip levels total - so now I'm providing 9 mips.

I also noticed that the IBL diffuse irradiance samples were not aligned! Now the normal's Y is flipped in the irradiance convolution.

When generating mipmaps I ran into a problem where sampling the original texture was always coming up [0.0, 0.0 0.0, 0.0]. It turns out that the sampler was trying to read from the mipmap at level 1, and of course it didn't exist yet as that was the one I was trying to generate. The fix was to sample a different texture - one without slots for the mipmaps, then throw away that texture.

I have to generate mipmaps to smooth out the irradiance and prefiltered cubemaps that we use for pbr shading.
