# loading-bytes

Sometimes loading things really bites. 

Let's say you just want to compile your program on native and web, but you've 
done a bit of loading in your call tree... 

You know what I'm talking about, I mean reading from the filesystem. Easy stuff - right? 

## WRONG!

Well, not really - it's still pretty easy - but it's a hassle, hoff!

## NOT ANYMORE.

That's right folks! Step right up and use this here little library to load things from 
the filesystem on native and through a web request on WASM! 

What you get back totally bytes!

## BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!

Act now and I'll throw in some "nice" enumerated error handling.

OK. You got me. That's free!

In fact, the whole thing is free! Take it or leave it, folks, the choice is yours.

`loading-bytes` - from the same company that brought you `streaming-nibbles`üêü... 

...Just kidding! 

Happy hacking :) ‚òï‚òï‚òï
