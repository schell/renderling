# renderling üçñ
This is a collection of WGPU renderers wrapped in a convenient interface.

## Features

* builder pattern for lights, cameras and objects
* automatic resource management (objects and cameras are removed from the scene and gpu resources released on drop)
* headless rendering support
  - rendering to texture and saving via `image` crate
* text rendering support (cargo feature `text` - on by default)
* nested nodes with local transforms
* gltf support

Shaders are written in GLSL. **shaderc** is used to compile shaders to SPIR-V.

## Definition
**renderling** noun

A wrapper around a WGPU graphics pipeline, along with simple types used to marshal data to the GPU.

## Pipelines

### Forward
A blinn-phong material forward shader.

![renderling forward shader pipeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schell/renderling/main/img/forward.png "renderling forward pipeline")

### UI
A simple forward shader that supports vertices with colors and/or textures. It has a special
blending uniform that determines how vertex colors should be blended with vertex UV texture
coords. This enables support for colorful text.

## Project Organization
* crates/renderling-shader

  Contains Rust shader code that can be shared on CPU and GPU.
  Most of the shader code is here!
  This crate is a member of the workspace so you get nice editor tooling while writing shaders in Rust.
  You can also write sanity tests that run with `cargo test`.
  Things just work like BAU.

* shaders

  Contains a thin `rust-gpu` wrapper around `renderling-shader`.
  Provides the GPU annotations needed to bind `renderling` and `renderling-shader`.
  Contains a program that compiles and copies **.spv** files into the main `renderling` crate.

* crates/renderling

  The main crate.
  Contains CPU Rust code for creating pipelines and managing resources, making render passes, etc.

* crates/example

  Contains an example of using the `renderling` crate to make an application.

## Tests

Tests use `renderling` in headless mode and generate images that are compared to expected output.

### Running tests

```
cargo test
```

## Building the shaders

The `shaders/` folder is a crate that is excluded from the cargo workspace.
It compiles into a program that can be run to generate the shaders:

```
cd shaders/ && cargo run --release
```

Currently they all compile into one monolithic `.spv` file, but that may change in the future.
