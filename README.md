# renderling üçñ
This is a collection of WGPU renderers wrapped in a convenient interface.

## Features

* automatic resource management
* builder pattern for lights, camera and objects
* gltf support
* headless rendering

Shaders are written in GLSL. **shaderc** is used to compile shaders to SPIR-V.

## Definition
**renderling** noun

A wrapper around a WGPU graphics pipeline, along with simple types used to marshal data to the GPU.

## Pipelines

### Forward
A blinn-phong material forward shader.

### UI
A simple forward shader that supports vertices with colors and/or textures. It has a special
blending uniform that determines how vertex colors should be blended with vertex UV texture
coords. This enables support for colorful text.

## Conveniences

* `Texture` type
* `Mesh` and `MeshBuilder` types
