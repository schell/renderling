# renderling üçñ

Renderling is an innovative, GPU-driven renderer designed for efficient scene rendering with a focus on leveraging 
GPU capabilities for nearly all rendering operations. 
Utilizing Rust for shader development, it ensures memory safety and cross-platform compatibility, including web platforms. 
The project, currently in the alpha stage, aims for rapid loading of GLTF files, handling large scenes, and supporting numerous lights. 
Development emphasizes performance, ergonomics, observability and the use of modern rendering techniques like forward+ rendering and 
physically based shading.

## Warning

This is very much a work in progress.

## What

`renderling` holds entire scenes of geometry, textures, materials, lighting, even the scene graph itself - in GPU buffers.
All but a few of the rendering operations happen on the GPU.
The CPU is used to interact with the filesystem to marshall data to the GPU and to update transforms.

Shaders are written in Rust, via `rust-gpu`.

## Why should I use `renderling`

* Data is easily staged on the GPU using an automatically reference counted slab allocator that 
  provides access from the CPU.

  Your scene geometry, materials, animations - all of it - live on the GPU, while the CPU has easy access
  to read and modify that data, without borrowing - allowing you to send your data through threads to anything 
  that needs it. 

* Having everything on the GPU makes `renderling` very effective at rendering certain types of scenes.
  
  Specifically `renderling` aims to be good at rendering scenes with a moderate level of unique geometry,
  (possibly a large amount of repeated geometry), with a small number of large textures (or large number of small textures),
  and lots of lighting effects.

* Tight integration with GLTF:
  - Loading scenes, nodes, animations etc
  - Includes tools for controlling animations
  - Supported extensions:
    * KHR_lights_punctual
    * KHR_materials_unlit
    * KHR_materials_emissive_strength
* Image based lighting + analytical lighting

* Good documentation

## API Features

* simple structs represent nodes, meshes, materials and lights
* seamless GPU / CPU syncronization
* headless rendering support
  - rendering to texture and saving via `image` crate
* text and user interface rendering support
* nested nodes with local transforms
* tight integration with glTF (cargo feature `gltf` - on by default)

Shaders are written in Rust via `rust-gpu` where possible, falling back to `wgsl` where needed.

## Rendering Features / Roadmap

Renderling takes a [forward+](https://takahiroharada.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/forward_plus.pdf) approach to rendering.

By default it uses a single uber-shader for rendering.

## Project Organization

* crates/renderling

  Main library crate.
  Contains CPU Rust code for creating pipelines and managing resources, making render passes, etc.
  Contains GPU Rust code of the shader operations themselves.
  Contains tests, some using image comparison of actual frame renders for consistency and backwards compatibility.

* crates/renderling/shaders

  Contains **.spv** and **.wgsl** files generated by [`cargo-gpu`](https://github.com/rust-gpu/cargo-gpu).

* crates/renderling/src/linkage*

  Contains autogenerated `wgpu` linkage for the generated shaders.

* img

  Image assets for tests (textures, etc.)

* test_img

  Reference images to use for testing.

* crates/example

  Contains an example of using the `renderling` crate to make an application.

## Tests

Tests use `renderling` in headless mode and generate images that are compared to expected output.

### Running tests

```
cargo test
```

## Building the shaders

The `crates/renderling/shaders/` folder contains the generated SPIR-V files.

To regenerate the shaders, run:

```
cargo shaders
```

There is a `.cargo/config.toml` alias for `cargo shaders` that expands into a larger 
shader compilation command.

## Building on WASM

```
RUSTFLAGS=--cfg=web_sys_unstable_apis trunk build crates/example-wasm/index.html && basic-http-server -a 127.0.0.1:8080 crates/example-wasm/dist
```
