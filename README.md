# renderling üçñ
This is a collection of WGPU renderers wrapped in a convenient interface.

## Features

* builder pattern for lights, cameras and objects
* automatic resource management (objects and cameras are removed from the scene and gpu resources released on drop)
* headless rendering support
  - rendering to texture and saving via `image` crate
* text rendering support (cargo feature `text` - on by default)
* nested nodes with local transforms
* gltf support

Shaders are written in GLSL. **shaderc** is used to compile shaders to SPIR-V.

## Definition
**renderling** noun

A wrapper around a WGPU graphics pipeline, along with simple types used to marshal data to the GPU.

## Pipelines

### Forward
A blinn-phong material forward shader.

### UI
A simple forward shader that supports vertices with colors and/or textures. It has a special
blending uniform that determines how vertex colors should be blended with vertex UV texture
coords. This enables support for colorful text.
